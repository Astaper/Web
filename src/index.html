    <p>If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. <i>They never say to you, "What does his voice sound like?</i> What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?" Instead, they demand: "<u>How old is he? How many brothers has he?</u> How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?" Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.</p>
    <p>Just so, you might say to them: "The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists." <mark>And what good would it do to tell them that?</mark> They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: "The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612," then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.

    </p>
    <p>It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, <span class="text">when I have never made any pictures except those</span> of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible.<b> But I am not at all sure of success.</b> One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject. <s>I make some errors</s>, too, in the little prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.</p>

    <h2>Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry - The little prince</h2>
    <h3>TO LEON WERTH</h3>
    <p>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children - although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:</p>
    <h3>TO LEON WERTH WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY</h3>
    <hr>
    <h3>I</h3>
    <p>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.</p>
    <img src="img/hroznys.jpg" alt="">
    <p>In the book it said: <span class="said">"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."</span></p>
    <p>I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:</p>
    <img src="img/klobouk.jpg" alt="">
    <p>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.</p>
    <p>But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</p>
    <p>My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:</p>
    <img src="img/slon.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.</p>
    <p>So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.</p>
    <p>In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.</p>
    <p>Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:</p>
    <p>"That is a hat."</p>
    <p>Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.</p>

    <h3>II</h3>
    <p><mark>So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.</mark></p>
    <p>The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:</p>
    <span class="italic">
        <p>"If you please--draw me a sheep!"</p>
        <p>"What!"</p>
        <p>"Draw me a sheep!"</p>
    </span>
    <p>I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.</p>
    <img src="img/malyPrinc.jpg" alt="">
    <p>That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.</p>
    <p>Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:</p>
    <p>"But--what are you doing here?"</p>
    <p>And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:</p>
    <p>"If you please--draw me a sheep..."</p>
    <p>When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:</p>
    <p>"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..."</p>
    <p>But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with:</p>
    <p><u>"No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep."</u></p>
    <p>So then I made a drawing.</p>
    <img src="img/nemocnyBeranek.jpg" alt="">
    <p>He looked at it carefully, then he said:</p>
    <p>"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."</p>
    <p>So I made another drawing.</p>
    <img src="img/Beran.jpg" alt="">
    <p>My friend smiled gently and indulgently.</p>
    <p>"You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns."</p>
    <p>So then I did my drawing over once more.</p>
    <p>But it was rejected too, just like the others.</p>
    <p>"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."</p>
    <img src="img/staryBeranek.jpg" alt="">
    <p>By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.</p>
    <img src="img/krabice.jpg" alt="">
    <p>And I threw out an explanation with it.</p>
    <p><i>"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."</i></p>
    <p>I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:</p>
    <p><i>"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?"</i></p>
    <p><i>"Why?"</i></p>
    <p><i>"Because where I live everything is very small..."</i></p>
    <p><i>"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small sheep that I have given you."</i></p>
    <p>He bent his head over the drawing.</p>
    <p><i>"Not so small that--Look! He has gone to sleep..."</i></p>
    <p>And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.</p>
